**Team Feynman Blog 1: April 6th 2020**

This past week as a team we have met with both Alex and Dr. Joerg in two separate meetings. Here we discussed cohesion of our game, and decided that we will have 3 levels total that each contain 3-4 rooms that need to be escaped to move onto the next level. Each of these levels will have similar mechanics that are used to solve the puzzle to open the next room. We decided that we want to each have one room that uses a mechanic to pick up objects, these puzzles will have the option to have objects that can be used to confuse the users attempts to solve the puzzle. The next room that each level will incorporate is a collectible room, where the user has to gather all the collectibles in the room to unlock the next area. These two mechanics will be similar across levels so that there will be a level of cohesion and we can use the same scripts and assets for these two ideas. The final room will be a unique puzzle that provides challenges to the player.

We also discussed the story of our game was going to be about escaping the game as a whole in a certain amount of time to add pressure and excitement to the player. We can also add in penalties and other mechanics if the player doesn’t finish in a certain amount of time. Furthermore, we can add time limits to each specific level to keep the player on track for the game.

Specifically last week Dinakar was working on his level in his game and working on various scripts,necessary for the animation triggers. Andrew created the scene management script as well as the lobby start scene and end scene. Andrew also created a basic pick up script that can pickup different types of objects, this script contains a carry location and drop location which can be used for all the other levels. Lastly, Andrew created the logic for the first puzzle in his level. Michael worked on his level design and started researching how to implement UIs in unity in order to assist in the storyline of the game. 


**Goal:**

The goal of our game is to engage our players with a multitude of different puzzles and levels given an extra measure of pressure with a time limit. The theme will be logic puzzles and challenges that the user will have to solve to escape from the rooms.

**Ideas on Style and Design:**

For the design of this game we will each take a different level so there will be 3 levels total. Each of us will take one level and have multiple challenges and puzzles. 

Michael’s level will have a scavenger hunt puzzle that gives hints to find certain items that will ultimately allow the player to move onto the next puzzle in his level. His next puzzle will be a color-coded puzzle which involves changing objects colors in the room to the desired color to complete the room. 

Andrew’s level will involve a room with a “shape puzzle”, this puzzle will provide multiple shapes (circle, triangle, square etc) to the user and ask them to order them once the user provides a proper order they can move onto the next room. Andrew’s next room will be a sequence challenge, objects will fall in a certain sequence and the user will be asked a specific question about the sequence if they get it right they will move on to the next room. Andrew’s other room will be a button/lever room where the buttons or levers will have to be interacted with in a certain order and once that certain order is done properly the user will be able to move on. 

Dinakar’s first room is a escape room puzzle and the user should find the object which opens the secret door to move to the next room. In the second room the user should move forward by jumping to safe spots and collect objects to move to the next level. 
Each level will be designed to have a continuous feeling with the other levels with similar game world types. Each specific puzzle will be designed to its specific needs so it will most likely be different from room to room but still keeping a general theme.
Player is in a building and will unlock different rooms as they complete tasks and find items. 

**Controls & UI:**

The player will be able to control the game by moving around with the WASD keys and be able to jump with the space bar. They will also be able to interact with each puzzle with clear interaction options displayed to the user. There will be a basic user interface to display to the user what needs to be done.



**Other Elements (NPCs, collectibles, dangers):**

There will be no other NPC’s the only character in our game will be the one the player control’s we chose this because we want the user to feel like they need to successfully complete the puzzles alone so that they feel the need to escape these isolated rooms. We will add collectibles and interactables to progress the puzzle and levels to allow for the user to move on in the game. Some potential dangers we could add are time penalties if the user does something incorrect, or we could have the result in a failure if the game is not completed in a certain time.

**Scripts:**

Some scripts that need to be programmed generally will include: Collection Logic, Story/UI Logic this includes the timer, room progression, level progression, Danger Logic, AI(Possible) logic, might need to alter code for the player controller Script. However, each of the puzzles will needed to be scripted as well as the room and level progression including swapping scenes to the next levels.

**Player's experience and interest curve & minimum playable game:**

Our minimal playable game will be a 3 leveled game where the user experiences multiple challenges and puzzles per level. We want to retain the users interest by providing them an experience that is always changing thus the different puzzles and challenges. With the different challenges and modes to play we believe the player will have an enjoyable experience because they will not have a necessarily hard learning curve to overcome but they will have difficulty with each puzzle that will not translate into making future puzzles easier.

**Contribution:**

This goes back to our design we mentioned earlier as we will each have scripts for each of our levels, we saw this separation as the easiest because we can design our levels to interact with each other, but provide the necessary separation so that we could own our scripts and our level individually. This was also done to prevent any issues with the collaboration aspects. 

**Plan for each build:**

For the first build we are planning to have our levels each laid out and considerable progress done with scripting each challenge and puzzle. This is mainly so that we can have a decently working product and be able to adapt and change our plan as necessary for our second build.

On our second build our goal is to add design elements and fix bugs that need to be fixed as well as finish up any part of our levels that were not already done from our first build. The goal for this build is to finish the final touches to the game, however sometimes this relates to stretch goals because it might not seem the hardest but could possibly take the longest amount of time to do.

**Meeting time:**

We plan to meet every Friday at 1:00 PM. At this point this seems like the time we will meet, but as the semester continues and we get more used to the current situation that we are in, our meeting time might change based on our team's needs.
